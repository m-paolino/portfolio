`hello_world!`

### Background :cowboy_hat_face:

My name is Paolo Minniti (call me *Paolino*!) and I'm from Sicily, Italy. I have a bachelor's degree in **Computer Science & Engineering** and a master of science in **Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning**, both achieved from the [Politecnico di Milano](https://polimi.it). I currently work as **junior Data Scientist** at [Accenture](https://accenture.com/it-it) in Milan and as tester of software and digital services in spare time.

I aim to push myself to the next level, from small everyday problems to more complicated tasks. If I'm not getting better, I'm getting worse.
I am sure we humans have the potential to learn something new through daily life challenges and to further the overall self-improvement. The main goal is to be better today than yesterday, with a plan to become even better tomorrow!

**TOP-PERFORMER • SELF-DETERMINED • TECH PASSIONATE**
