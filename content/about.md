`hello_world!`

### Background :cowboy_hat_face:

My name is Paolo Minniti, but you can call me _Paolino_! I hail from Sicily, the largest Mediterranean island in Italy. I hold a bachelor's degree in **Computer Science & Engineering** and a master of science in **Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning**, both achieved from the [Politecnico di Milano](https://polimi.it). I am currently serving as **Junior Data Scientist** at [Accenture](https://accenture.com/it-it) in Milan, keeping a keen eye on the latest **tech advancements** in _Artificial Intelligence_.

My personal philosophy revolves around constantly challenging myself, from tackling small everyday problems to handling more complex tasks. I firmly believe that if I'm not progressing, I'm regressing. My journey is characterized by persistence and resilience.
I am sure we humans have the potential to learn something new through daily life challenges and to further the overall self-improvement. The ultimate goal is to be better today than yesterday, with a strategic plan for continuous improvement.

### Hobbies and interests :game_die:

Outside of work, I enjoy reading mystery and self-help books, indulging in sci-fi and comedy movies and TV shows.
Aspiring chef and strong impulse for chess (here is my [Lichess](https://lichess.org/@/misterpaolino) profile and old [Chess.com](https://chess.com/member/misterpaolino) profile), sudoku puzzles and motorsport races fan.\
In my free time, I love to spend time with my family and friends, work out (I am a little obsessed), and I am a big fan of amateur sports with other people.
Lastly, loving to discover and venture into new places around the world, bringing me the real adventure and thrill.
