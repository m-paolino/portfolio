`hello_world!`

### Background :cowboy_hat_face:

My name is Paolo Minniti (call me *Paolino*!) and I'm from Sicily, the largest Mediterranean island in Italy. I have a bachelor's degree in **Computer Science & Engineering** and a master of science in **Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning**, both achieved from the [Politecnico di Milano](https://polimi.it). I currently work as **Data Scientist jr.** at [Accenture](https://accenture.com/it-it) in Milan and as tester of software and digital services in spare time, with an eye on the latest **technology advancements** in *Artificial Intelligence* area.

I aim to push myself to the next level, from small everyday problems to more complicated tasks. If I'm not getting better then I'm getting worse, my journey is one of persistence and resilience.
I am sure we humans have the potential to learn something new through daily life challenges and to further the overall self-improvement. The main goal is to be better today than yesterday, with a plan to become even better tomorrow!

**TOP-PERFORMER • SELF-DETERMINED • TECH PASSIONATE**

### Hobbies and interests :game_die:

Outside of work, I do like to spend time reading mystery or self-help genre books and following a number of sci-fi or comedy genre movies and TV shows (check out my [TV Time](https://www.tvtime.com/it/user/47571880/profile) profile).\
Aspiring chef and strong impulse to play chess (here is my [Lichess](https://lichess.org/@/misterpaolino) profile and old [Chess.com](https://chess.com/member/misterpaolino) profile), to play sudoku puzzles and to watch motorsport races.\
In my free time, I love to spend time with my family and friends, work out (I am a little obsessed), and I am a big fan of amateur sports with other people.
Lastly, loving to discover and venture into new places around the world, bringing me the real adventure and thrill.
